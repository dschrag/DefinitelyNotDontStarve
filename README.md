# Definitely Not Don't Starve

Survival game that has crafting and insanity and darkness but in VR, but its not Don't Starve, I promise. It totally isn't. Really. 

# The Story

You wake up deep in a cave. You need to escape while managing your stamina, hunger, and other stats, all without going completely insane. Traverse a uniquely generated cave system piece by piece as you work your way through each level of the cave system on your way to safety and freedom. 

# Features

## Random Worlds

Every level of the cave is randomly generated each time you play.

## Manage your Insanity
 
Manage your insanity as you try to escape. Sanity is affected by a variety of factors such as hunger and stamina. You need to make it to the end before your insanity prevents you from continuing.

# Contributing

All code here is meant to be as open as possible (given the constraints of Unreal Engine). Issues will be used to track progress as best as possible.

## Issue Labels

Issues will be labeled by category and type (cave-generation or core-mechanic as well as bug or enhancement). Pleas keep issues well tagged for the sake of organization. 

## Git Limitations

Unfortunately, Unreal Engine does not lend itself to Git very well. Files are all binary and this repo will likely grow rather quickly. To help mitigate this please limit pushes to this repository. Whenever an issue or multiple related issues are completed please squash the commits into one when possible. Information on how to do this can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git). We all make mistakes though. Try your best. 

## Milestones

Issues should generally be tracked in milestones where possible. This should help organization from week to week. 

# Wiki

The wiki for this repo will be the primary source of game information, rules, goals, and the like.
